\description{
This function create an q-feature obj, containing the DIA-NN precursor intensities in the assay precursor.
ColData is also set with the experiment design information. Several sanity checks are performed like:
1)  columns present in design file
2)  check number and  sample name found in the DIA-NN report and in the design file
3) check confounder variable present in the design file
Finally name matching between run in DIA-report andin the design file is done,
using params$wildstr_run to select the run name among the the other information columns
