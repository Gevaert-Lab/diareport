\usage{
run_workflow_pipeline(initial_input, steps, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_input}{A named list containing the initial state or data required by the pipeline.}

\item{steps}{A list of step functions, each accepting a single list argument and returning a list.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to each step function.}
}
\value{
The final state list returned by the last step function in the pipeline.
}
\description{
Executes a sequence of workflow step functions in order, passing the result of each step
as input to the next. Each step function should accept a single list argument (the current
workflow state) and return a list with updated state. This function is suitable for modular,
extensible workflow pipelines, such as those used in DIA report processing.
}
\details{
If any step function returns a list with a `status` element set to 1, the pipeline
stops with an error using the `error` element of that list.
